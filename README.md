The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

**Note: Because of the impossibility of work together the two brushes in one graph(because only one layer is active for events) I had to make extra functionality for the area selecting.
Charts performances tested in Chrome inspector using Performance tab.**
