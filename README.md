**Note: to improve application performance and do deeper testing we can use React + D3 + `react-faux-dom` [https://github.com/Olical/react-faux-dom] So, using the faux dom we can use all the D3.js API methods and explore snapshot testing**

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about for more information.

**Note: There is only one test for Application. **
